# The Giver by Lois Lowry

## Introduction

"The Giver" is a dystopian novel set in a seemingly perfect society where everything is controlled and regulated. The story follows **Jonas**, an eleven-year-old boy who lives in a community where there is no pain, suffering, or choice. When Jonas is selected to become the new **Receiver of Memory**, he begins to understand the dark secrets behind his community's perfect facade.

The novel explores important themes including:
- The importance of memory and emotion

- The cost of achieving a "perfect" society
- The value of human experience, both good and bad

## Story Setting and World

### The Community

The story takes place in a **futuristic community** where citizens live according to strict rules and regulations. This society has achieved **Sameness** - a state where all differences have been eliminated to create stability and predictability.

Key features of the community:
- **Climate Control**: No natural weather variations
- **No Colors**: Citizens cannot see colors
- **Precise Language**: Everyone must use exact, accurate words
- **Assigned Roles**: All jobs and family units are assigned by the Committee of Elders
- **No Choices**: Major life decisions are made by the community

### Family Units

Families in the community are carefully constructed:
- Each family unit consists of one mother, one father, and two children (one male, one female)
- Children are not biologically related to their parents
- Spouses are matched by the Committee of Elders based on compatibility
- Family members share their **feelings** each evening during dinner

### Important Rituals

The community has many ceremonies and rituals:
- **Ceremony of Twelve**: When children receive their life Assignments
- **Ceremony of One**: When babies are named and given to families
- **Release**: When people leave the community (the true nature is hidden from citizens)
- **Evening Sharing of Feelings**: Daily family ritual
- **Dream-telling**: Morning ritual where family members share dreams

## Main Characters

### Jonas

**Jonas** is the protagonist, an eleven-year-old boy who becomes the Receiver of Memory. He has **pale eyes** (unusual in the community) which marks him as different. Jonas is intelligent, thoughtful, and begins to question his society after receiving memories.

Character traits:
- Observant and sensitive
- Follows rules initially but becomes rebellious
- Capable of "**seeing beyond**" (perceiving things others cannot)
- Develops strong emotions and understanding through memories

### The Giver

**The Giver** is the old man who trains Jonas. He is the current Receiver of Memory who holds all of the community's memories of the past. He is wise, compassionate, and deeply affected by the burden of holding painful memories alone.

The Giver:
- Has pale eyes like Jonas
- Experienced great loss with the previous Receiver, Rosemary
- Becomes a mentor and father figure to Jonas
- Helps Jonas plan his escape to save Gabriel

### Gabriel (Gabe)

**Gabriel** is a newchild (baby) who Jonas's father brings home from the Nurturing Center. Gabriel has **pale eyes** like Jonas and struggles to sleep through the night, which puts him at risk of being released.

Important facts about Gabriel:
- Jonas gives him memories to help him sleep
- He shares the ability to receive memories with Jonas
- Jonas takes him when escaping the community
- Represents innocence and hope

### Jonas's Family

**Father**: A **Nurturer** who cares for newchildren. He is gentle and kind but doesn't understand the true meaning of release.

**Mother**: Works at the **Department of Justice**. She is practical and follows community rules strictly.

**Lily**: Jonas's seven-year-old sister. She is talkative, curious, and follows all community rules without question.

### Friends

**Asher**: Jonas's best friend who struggles with **precise language** and often mixes up words. He is assigned as **Assistant Director of Recreation**.

**Fiona**: Jonas's female friend who has distinctive **red hair** (though most people cannot see it). She works at the **House of the Old** and is training to be a Caretaker.

### Rosemary

**Rosemary** was the Receiver-in-training before Jonas. She failed in her training after only five weeks when she couldn't handle the painful memories. She applied for **release**, and when she died, all the memories she had received returned to the community, causing chaos.

## Key Concepts and Themes

### Sameness

**Sameness** is the fundamental principle of Jonas's community. It eliminates all differences to create a stable, predictable society.

What was eliminated:
- Colors and visual differences
- Weather variations (Climate Control)
- Emotional depth and strong feelings
- Individual choice in major life decisions
- Physical pain and suffering
- Cultural and personal differences

### Memory and the Receiver

The **Receiver of Memory** is the most honored position in the community. This person holds all memories of the past - both good and bad - so that others don't have to experience pain or difficulty.

Responsibilities include:
- Receiving and holding all memories from before Sameness
- Advising the Committee of Elders when needed
- Training the next Receiver
- Bearing the burden of pain and suffering alone

### Seeing Beyond

**Seeing beyond** is the special capacity that Jonas has. It means the ability to perceive things that others cannot, such as:
- Colors (especially red)
- Deeper truths about the community
- The possibility of change
- The value of individual experience

### Stirrings

**Stirrings** are the first sexual feelings that occur during adolescence. In the community, these feelings are immediately suppressed with daily pills. Jonas stops taking his pill because he wants to experience genuine emotions.

### Release

**Release** is presented as sending someone "Elsewhere," but Jonas discovers the horrifying truth: release means **death by lethal injection**.

People are released for:
- Breaking major rules three times
- Being too old (elderly)
- Being weak or imperfect (newchildren)
- Requesting it (rare)

## Key Terms and Vocabulary

### Assignments

**Assignments** are the jobs given to Twelves at the Ceremony of Twelve. The Committee of Elders carefully observes children throughout their childhood to determine the most appropriate Assignment for each person.

### Receiver of Memory

The **Receiver of Memory** is the person who holds all memories of the past for the entire community. Only one person at a time can hold this position. The Receiver experiences colors, emotions, and experiences that no one else in the community can understand.

### Capacity to See Beyond

The **capacity to see beyond** is a special ability that both Jonas and The Giver possess. It allows them to perceive things that others cannot, particularly the ability to see colors and understand deeper truths about their world.

### Precision of Language

**Precision of language** is a strict community rule requiring citizens to use exact, accurate words. Exaggeration and imprecise descriptions are corrected immediately. For example, saying "I'm starving" when you're just hungry is considered imprecise and incorrect.

### Nurturer

A **Nurturer** is someone assigned to care for newchildren in their first year of life. Jonas's father is a Nurturer. Nurturers provide all physical and emotional care for babies before they are given to family units.

### Committee of Elders

The **Committee of Elders** is the governing body that makes all important decisions for the community, including Assignments, matching spouses, and creating rules. They consult the Receiver of Memory for advice on difficult decisions.

### Dwelling

A **dwelling** is the word used for a house or home in the community. Each family unit lives in a dwelling that is essentially identical to all others.

### Elsewhere

**Elsewhere** refers to any place outside the community. Citizens believe that people who are released go to Elsewhere to live peacefully. Only Jonas and The Giver know the truth about release.

### Comfort Object

A **comfort object** is a soft toy given to small children to help them sleep. Lily has a stuffed elephant, and Gabriel has a stuffed hippo. Children must give up their comfort objects when they become Eights.

## Plot Summary

### The Beginning: Life in the Community

The story begins in December as Jonas approaches the **Ceremony of Twelve** where he will receive his life Assignment. Jonas lives with his parents and sister Lily in a community where everything is controlled. 

One day, Jonas sees an apple **change** while playing catch with Asher - it's his first experience of seeing color (red). He feels **apprehensive** (not frightened) about the upcoming ceremony.

Jonas's father brings home a newchild named **Gabriel** who isn't developing properly and is at risk of being released.

### The Ceremony and Selection

At the Ceremony of Twelve, Jonas is initially skipped, causing him great anxiety. Then he learns he has been selected for the highest honor: to be the new **Receiver of Memory**. The Chief Elder explains that Jonas has the special capacity to "**see beyond**."

Jonas receives his Assignment instructions, which include shocking new rules:
- He may ask any question (exemption from rudeness)
- He may not tell his dreams
- He cannot apply for release
- **He may lie** (the most disturbing rule)

### Training with The Giver

Jonas begins training with the old Receiver, who tells Jonas to call him **The Giver**. The Giver transmits memories by placing his hands on Jonas's bare back.

Jonas's first memory is of a **sled ride in the snow** - his first experience of real cold and joy. Soon he receives the memory of **sunshine** and **sunburn**, experiencing both pleasure and pain.

The Giver gradually gives Jonas more complex memories:
- Colors (especially **red**)
- Animals (including an **elephant** being killed)
- Emotions like love and loneliness
- Warfare and death
- Family celebrations and **Christmas**
- **Grandparents** and family love

### Discovering the Truth

As Jonas learns more, he becomes increasingly disturbed by his community:

1. He stops taking his **pills for Stirrings** because he wants to feel emotions
2. He learns what "**love**" means and realizes his parents don't understand it
3. He discovers that **Fiona** has red hair (he can now see colors)
4. He learns about the previous Receiver, **Rosemary**, who failed and was released

The most shocking discovery comes when Jonas watches a video of a **release**. His father is releasing one of a set of twins (the smaller one), and Jonas realizes that "release" means **killing** the person with a lethal injection. His father cheerfully murders the baby and disposes of the body in a chute.

### Planning the Escape

Devastated by this discovery, Jonas and The Giver create a plan for Jonas to escape the community. If Jonas leaves, all his memories will return to the community, forcing citizens to experience emotions and understand their past. This might lead to change.

The plan is accelerated when Jonas learns that **Gabriel** is scheduled to be released. Jonas cannot let this happen.

### The Journey to Elsewhere

Jonas takes Gabriel and escapes on his father's bicycle. He must:
- Avoid search planes by giving Gabriel memories of **cold** to hide their body heat
- Find food and shelter as they travel
- Overcome exhaustion, hunger, and injury
- Keep moving toward "Elsewhere"

The journey becomes increasingly difficult as they face:
- Starvation and extreme hunger
- Search planes looking for them
- Physical pain and injury (Jonas's ankle is twisted)
- Cold weather and eventually snow

### The Ambiguous Ending

As Jonas and Gabriel near death from cold and starvation, Jonas finds a sled at the top of a hill - exactly like the one from his first memory. They sled down the hill together, and Jonas hears **music** and sees lights in the distance.

The ending is deliberately ambiguous:
- Are they reaching a real community with warmth and love?
- Or is Jonas hallucinating as they die in the snow?
- Readers must decide for themselves what really happens

## Important Scenes

### The Apple Incident

Jonas is playing catch with Asher when he notices the apple **changing** in mid-air. This is his first experience of seeing the color red and "seeing beyond." He takes the apple home (against the rules) to examine it, which leads to an announcement reminding citizens not to take recreation area items.

### First Memory: The Sled

Jonas's first memory from The Giver is of riding a sled down a snowy hill. This is his first experience of:
- Real weather (snow and cold)
- The color **white**
- Pure joy and exhilaration
- The physical world before Climate Control

This positive memory prepares Jonas for the more difficult memories to come.

### The Sunburn Memory

The Giver gives Jonas a memory of intense **sunburn** to teach him about physical pain. Jonas experiences excruciating burning sensations and learns that pain cannot be easily treated like in his community. This memory shows Jonas the cost of the community's protection.

### Learning About Color

The Giver explains that Jonas is beginning to see the color **red**. Jonas learns that:
- The community eliminated color when they chose Sameness
- Fiona has distinctive red hair
- Colors existed throughout history
- The community gave up beauty to gain control

This revelation makes Jonas angry about everything the community has lost.

### The Family Christmas Memory

The Giver shares his favorite memory: a **Christmas** celebration with a family sitting around a fire, exchanging presents, with **grandparents** present. Jonas experiences:
- **Love** - a word he's never heard before
- Multi-generational family connections
- The warmth of genuine relationships
- What his community has sacrificed

This memory profoundly affects Jonas and makes him question everything about his society.

### The Elephant Memory

Jonas receives a disturbing memory of an **elephant** being killed by hunters with guns. He watches as:
- The elephant is shot for its ivory tusks
- Another elephant mourns over the body
- The surviving elephant covers the corpse with branches
- The elephant roars in grief and rage

This memory teaches Jonas about loss, grief, and the cruelty humans are capable of.

### The Warfare Memory

The most painful memory Jonas receives is of **warfare**. He experiences:
- Lying wounded on a battlefield
- Seeing a dying boy begging for water
- Feeling his own life slipping away
- The horror of human violence and death
- The sounds and smells of death

This memory is so painful that The Giver apologizes and doesn't give Jonas difficult memories for a while afterward.

### Discovering What "Love" Means

After learning about love from the Christmas memory, Jonas goes home and asks his parents:

**Jonas**: "Do you love me?"

His parents are flustered and correct his language use. They explain that "love" is too imprecise and meaningless. Instead, they say they "enjoy him" and "take pride in his accomplishments."

Jonas realizes his parents don't understand real love, and he tells his first lie to them, saying he understands.

### Witnessing a Release

The Giver shows Jonas a video recording of a **release ceremony**. Jonas watches in horror as:
- His father brings in newborn **twins**
- His father weighs both babies
- His father selects the smaller twin for release
- His father injects the baby with a lethal substance
- The baby dies
- His father disposes of the body in a trash chute
- His father cheerfully cleans up and says "Bye-bye, little guy"

This scene shatters Jonas's innocence and makes him realize the true horror of his community.

### The Escape

Jonas's final escape is triggered when he learns Gabriel will be released the next morning. He:
- Takes his father's bicycle
- Steals food
- Takes Gabriel from his crib
- Leaves in the middle of the night

The journey is desperate and dangerous, testing Jonas's resolve and strength as he fights to save both Gabriel and himself.

## Themes and Analysis

### Memory and History

The novel shows that memory is essential to humanity. Without memories of the past:
- People cannot learn from mistakes
- Society cannot make informed decisions
- Citizens lose their humanity and depth
- No one understands the value of their existence

The Giver tells Jonas: "The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain. It's the **loneliness** of it. Memories need to be shared."

### Freedom versus Safety

The community has traded **freedom for safety**:
- No choices means no wrong decisions
- No pain means no real joy either
- No differences means no conflict
- No emotions means no love

Jonas realizes that this trade-off has made people less than human. He says: "I want to wake up in the morning and **decide** things!"

### The Value of Emotion

Jonas discovers that emotions - even painful ones - are what make life worth living:
- **Love** creates deep family bonds
- **Grief** shows the value of what was lost
- **Anger** motivates change
- **Joy** makes existence meaningful

Without these feelings, people are merely existing, not truly living.

### Individuality versus Sameness

The community has eliminated all individuality to create Sameness:
- Everyone looks similar
- All families are structured identically
- Personal preferences don't exist
- Unique talents are suppressed

Jonas learns that individuality is essential to human dignity and worth.

### The Cost of a "Perfect" Society

The novel questions whether a perfect, painless society is worth achieving:
- Citizens are content but not truly happy
- There is no growth or development
- People lack depth and genuine connection
- The price (death, control, loss of humanity) is too high

### Knowledge and Ignorance

Jonas faces a classic dilemma: is it better to know painful truths or remain in ignorant bliss?

The citizens of the community are happy because they don't know what they're missing. Jonas suffers because he knows the truth. However, Jonas ultimately chooses **knowledge and truth** over comfortable ignorance.

### Coming of Age

Jonas's journey is a coming-of-age story where he:
- Loses his innocence
- Gains wisdom and understanding
- Learns to question authority
- Takes responsibility for his choices
- Sacrifices his comfort to do what's right

## Symbols in the Novel

- Passion and emotion

## Important Quotes and Their Meanings

### "The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain. It's the loneliness of it."

This quote from The Giver expresses the burden of being the only one who remembers the past. Memories are meant to be shared - they connect us to others and help us understand our common humanity. Being the sole keeper of memories is an isolating experience.

### "If you were to be lost in the river, Jonas, your memories would not be lost with you. Memories are forever."

The Giver explains that memories are not destroyed when a person dies - they return to the people. This becomes the basis for Jonas's escape plan and shows that memory is something greater than any individual.

### "We gained control of many things. But we had to let go of others."

The Giver explains the trade-off the community made when choosing Sameness. They gained stability, predictability, and safety, but lost colors, emotions, real love, and genuine experience. The novel questions whether this trade was worth it.

### "I want them! It isn't fair that nothing has color!"

Jonas's angry outburst when he realizes the community has deliberately eliminated colors shows his growing awareness that the community has taken away beautiful and meaningful experiences. This represents his rejection of Sameness.

### "Things could change, Gabe. Things could be different. I don't know how, but there must be some way for things to be different."

Jonas whispers this to sleeping Gabriel, showing his growing awareness that change is possible and his developing hope for a better world. This sets the stage for his eventual escape.
